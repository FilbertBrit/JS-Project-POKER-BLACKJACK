# JS-Project-POKER-BLACKJACK

## Background

Poker is a popular card game and some may say a big part American culture. There are many 
variations of the game poker. Poker typically has a dealer and (2-5) players and is played with a 
standard 52-card deck. 
> **Card Ranks:** A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A

## General Principle of Game

Players can receive upto 5 cards, which makes up their "poker hand".
The dealer will also draw upto 5 cards, cards players could also use to strengthen their 
hand.

Players can raise, call, or fold during their turn based on how strong they feel their 
hands currently is. 
   
- Raise: changing the current bet to a higher bet
- Call: matching the current bet to stay in the game
- Fold: opting out of matching current bet and withdraw from current round/game

The goal is to win the "pot" of bets. Players can win by having the best hand or by simply
making a bet no one can or is willing to bet.
